# 1D arterial flow 
This code solves the 1D arterial flow in bifurcating compliant vessel using FEniCS finite element library. The implementation is detailed in Implementation_Details.pdf.
To run the demo for the y shaped bifurcating vessel, navigate to src directory and do
```
python3 demo.py inputs/yBifurcation.in
```
